Try and get the numbers in the correct order, starting on the top left corner by rows.
Use WASD/Arrows to move the empty spaces around.
Alternatively, click the tile you'd like to move into the empty space with the mouse.

Pressing R would reroll numbered and empty arrangement on the board, while adding Shift would reroll walls too.
Use space to reopen the generation menu, Shift+ESC to close the app.
Pressing ESC when a pop-up message appears would close it, Enter would confirm it when the confirm button is visible.
Arrow keys may also be used for navigating the Loader screen.

Enjoy!

This project exists thanks to many friends who helped me playtest and rethink along the way.
I'd also like to thank mwbraynt for making the project that gave me the initial direction as to how to use a clicked grid: https://github.com/mwbryant/logic_management_game/tree/master
